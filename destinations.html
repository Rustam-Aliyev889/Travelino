    <h1 class="header">Why People Travel?</h1>
    <h2 class="reason">1. Experience A Different Way Of Life And Shift Your Perspective</h2>
    <p>When we travel to different locations, there is so much to be explored and experienced by us. Any new place you visit will have a different feel to it, it may be a total contrast to what you are used to or it may have similarities. Nonetheless, this new place can be a teacher for you.
      The world is a big place, and there are so many different ways people live around the world. When we are so used to our current society’s structures, and way of living and being, we can become fixed in our current perspective and lack the awareness of how other people live and experience life. 
      As we explore new places and connect with different people and cultures, we can see a different way of living and perceiving the world. We may go to countries where there is poverty and suffering or perhaps freedom and abundance.
      When we experience something vastly different from what we are used to, we can then have a bit of a reality check. We recognize how blessed we are, how abundant we are, and how perhaps we take things like food, clothing, and housing for granted, as others are not so fortunate.
      Being able to shift our perspective and have an open mind and experience a different way of life through the activity of travel, we can move forward living life to the fullest. We can have more appreciation for what we have and for life. 
      We can see how sacred and fragile life can be and also the polarity that exists. We can learn to never judge anyone else’s life and choices, as we have no idea where they have come from or what they have been through.
      Therefore, we can honor and accept people as they are, as we know they may have had a vastly different upbringing and life.
      </p>

      <h2 class="reason">2. Learn To Live In The Present Moment And Be Resilient</h2>
      <p>When you are traveling, you give yourself permission to explore and experience places from a place of curiosity and wonder. You don’t dwell on the past or think too far ahead in the future. Instead, you are present with your now-moment experience.
         Many people who go traveling overseas take time off work and perhaps take weeks, if not months, off from their normal day-to-day life. This gives them the freedom to not worry about anything but instead, to be living life day by day, exploring exciting places or experiencing the simplicity of being open to where they feel guided to go next.
         When you travel, you tend to be up to trying new things. A trip far away may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you, and so you want to experience all of it and say yes to what arises in the moment. 
         You can look around and take in your environment and be there fully present, which is an important skill to have in life to avoid unnecessary stress, worry, and anxieties about the future. You can also build resilience as you never know what experience or situation you may end up in, but you learn to move through them.
      </p>

      <h2 class="reason">3. Connect Deeper With Yourself And With Others</h2>
      <p>Traveling can not only enable you to connect deeper with yourself but also with people that you meet along the way. If you always spend your time with the same people, you may find when you are traveling that connecting deeply with other travelers or the locals is truly fulfilling for you.
        You can listen to the stories and lives of others and form great bonds. You also connect deeper to yourself as you learn about who you are, as you may face challenges or fears during your travels.  
        Traveling is important in life as it opens you up to more connections and deeper intimacy with life itself, other people, and cultures as well as with yourself as you break out of the box you have put yourself in.
